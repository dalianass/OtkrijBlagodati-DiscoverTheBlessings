                    [Noah, 'alaihis-salam', flooded the entire planet with a prayer of only a few words: "I am defeated, and You take revenge!" - reads the engraving of the monument of conviction, in my opinion.]
                    "Ask Allah as if you were watching in front of you what you are asking for. You can almost feel it with your hand. And it will come." [Hfz. prof. Hanka Vlahovljak]
                    Allah the Exalted says in the hadith qudsiyya: "I am with the opinion of My slave about Me." [Bukhari]
                    Therefore, as someone who has been given the grace of the opinion that there is nothing impossible with the Almighty, do not hesitate to be convinced that you will get them - if they are from hajr for you - you are looking for even the most valuable things your mind can comprehend; for Allah's treasures are indeed inexhaustible - "My slaves, if all of you, both men and jinn, stood in one field from the first to the last and all asked of Me, and if He would give every man what He asks, it would not diminish that which I possess, except as much as the needle diminishes the waters of the sea when it is dipped. " [Muslim]
                    Arrange the field of your prayers - they, due to lack of conviction, have already withered, strengthen them with perseverance in the same, and support them by relying on Allah Almighty. Cast out the dark clouds of haram around the soul, to illuminate them. Protect them with alms and good deeds; free yourself from the persistent weeds of hopelessness, and shed tears of sincerity. Then, wait for Allah Almighty to keep His promise - "Call on Me and ask, I will answer you!" [Al-Mu'min, 60] - and provide you with the appropriate fruits of your prayers in the different seasons of your needs.
                    He resolutely carries a harvest basket, like that man who carries an umbrella when people go to gather to pray for rain during a drought; for one should go back dry, just as the gifts of Almighty Allah do not stop in a handful!
                    "Lord, we truly think that you will make us happy, and give success and happiness to both worlds, and we think and hope that we may see Your Majestic Face. And You grant us the good of You, O You, Who give and give abundantly!" [Hfz. prof. Halida Dacic-Dazdarevic]
                    Before you fall asleep, activate the alarm of your conviction, so that the melody of the reality of your desire will wake you up tomorrow.
                    Let it be tonight!

                <p class="p1"> 
                    The Prophet, sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, said: People will not sit down to remember Allah, dzellesha'nuhu, without the angels covering them with their wings, when the mercy of God and serenity will descend on them, and Allah will mention them to those who are close to Him. !! Muslim
                    The blessings we enjoyed a few months ago: regular hefty lectures in almost all mosques, rings of the Qur'an and tafsir, sittings for women ...
                    These same benefits, after being struck by the current temptation, have been replaced by mobile and computer screens. In addition to the great blessings given to us in them, online classrooms still cannot replace what the Prophet, sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, informed us about in the above-mentioned hadith.
                    Did we then, when we only preferred some other activity over the lecture that was organized in the nearby mosque, and missed it just like that, without a valid reason, think that this grace could be denied to us?
                    How and whether the hearts of believers would endure this grace to be permanently denied to us is something we are afraid to think about.
                    May the current situation help us to discover the blessings that have been hidden by our constant presence.
                    Let us deserve the company of the pure creatures of Allah, their seeking forgiveness for the believers, the seekers of knowledge, the boasting of Allah before them to those who mention Him in society, and let us keep all this by attending the sittings at which He is mentioned.

                    <p class="p1">“We have placed you on Earth and given you everything you need for life. - And how little you thank!" (Al-A’raf, 10)
                        You were a little kid once, so someone taught you not to put your fingers on a hot plate. He also taught you not to talk to strangers, not to play with sharp objects. He also taught you that a snake is not the same as a dog or a cat. And even if an eagle is not the same as a pigeon.
                        All that, if it weren't for someone to teach you, you would have learned it yourself - the hard way. But then there would already be scars on you that would testify to all this, and much more.
                        When you grow up a little, then they stop teaching you these things, and they teach you those that always contain the sentence "I went that way." And some people listen to that advice and mostly pass - without scars. Without those scars.
                        And some say "You don't understand that", and learn much later, vaguely nodding their heads, staring into the distance, that someone was right then, a long time ago.
                        
                        I'm not saying that every older person knows very well what is best for us, but I do say that those older people mostly know what is not best for us.
                        
                        You don't always have to accept what someone older tells you, but you can, and should, think about it nicely, and not categorically reject it, without thinking.
                        
                        It is necessary - because many today are longing for their scars on their souls, and they would not be there, if they had only thought a little better about the advice that was given to them.
                        "(…) And if you counted Allah's bounties, you would not enumerate them - Man is indeed unjust and ungrateful." (Ibrahim, 34)

                "What do you think: the water you drink - do you or We lower it from the clouds? If we want, we can make it salty - so why aren't you grateful?" (Surat al-Waqi'a, 68-70)
                Pluviophile - a name for a person who finds peace and happiness while raindrops create a soothing melody and a wonderful atmosphere. I believe that for many of us, this experience is a special blessing.
                However, raindrops are also an important link in the harmony of vital processes, which our Lord has created so extraordinarily.
                Namely, they have in themselves a magical substance - water, which is the source of life, and each of those lives that sprout through water, and the will of our Lord, represent a special grace and have a certain importance and role in our lives.
                The rain that falls cleans the surface of the earth, as well as the air from pollution. But it does not stop there, but goes to the deeper layers of the earth, where, flowing through the rocks, it purifies and dissolves minerals. As such, it feeds the plants with the help of roots, so we get a variety of fruits that we eat, use as medicines, as well as in many other applications, ranging from cosmetics to the production of gum. All these plants, in addition to practical application, adorn our planet with their beauty and color, so they represent the atmosphere and the eye and sense of smell. With the help of rain, huge forests grow, which are the lungs of our planet, because they produce oxygen to a huge extent, and thanks to that we breathe.
                "He it is Who descends from the water the water you drink, and it helps the plants you graze to sprout. for people who think. "(Surat an-Na'l, 10-11)
                Then, the rain that has reached the ground and cleared itself by traveling through the rocks, passes through the underground to the source of drinking water on the surface of the earth, so we can quench our thirst with it. More such springs form rivers, inhabited by aquatic organisms, such as fish, which they use as food, and more rivers flow into the sea.
                Therefore, thank Allah who rains down on us and stores with it the many blessings we enjoy.

                These people have made the world a better place than the one they found.
                Many will think that these are rare exceptions and that great changes in humanity require strong groups of people guided by the saying "one swallow does not make spring."
                If such a thought occurs to us, let us neutralize its harmful effect by quoting Necmettin Erbakan, "One swallow does not make a spring, but every spring begins with one swallow."
                How many people have moved recently, a few hundred or even thousands of years ago, and today, in the 21st century, we are still reaping the fruits of their discoveries in religious or secular sciences.
                "The sweetness of success is that you start something that won't end with you."
                • We all have the opportunity, both learned and unlearned. Scientists to transfer that knowledge to others, and uneducated to acquire that knowledge. On the path of positive change, we may not change the course of history so much, but we will certainly contribute to our family, community, and perhaps the state, at least through our progress.
                It is narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that Muhammad, 'alaihis-salam', said: "When a person moves to the hereafter, he ceases to receive rewards for good deeds except in three cases: permanent alms, knowledge used by others after his death and well-mannered a child who prays for him.

                <h2 class="h2-tekst">The blessing of gentleness</h2>
                <p class="p1">
                    There are many blessings that Allah Almighty, jalla she'nuhu, has bestowed on His slaves, and especially those who have been given the quality of gentleness are distinguished.
                    Whoever finds the quality of gentleness is a sign that Allah Almighty, jalla she'nuhu, has loved him, as stated in numerous Qur'anic and hadith texts.
                    First of all, it is important to emphasize that gentleness (al-hilm) is one of the attributes of Allah Almighty, jalla she'nuhu, who revealed in the Qur'an: "Know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful." (Al-Baqara, 235)
                    Mildness was a special feature of our Prophet, sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, and it was precisely this that was the reason for winning people's hearts, as Allah Almighty, jalla she'nuhu, informs us in His Book:
                    "By the grace of Allah alone, you are kind to them; and if you were rude and rude, they would run away from you." (Ali-Imran, 159)
                    The Prophet, sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, praised Al-Ashjaj Abdulkais when he said to him, "Indeed, you possess two qualities that Allah loves: gentleness and benevolence." Muslim
                    This praiseworthy quality of faith is less and less present in our lives.
                    Instant - life, struggle for existence, ignorance, temptations - all this has led to a loss of patience in dealing with people, which especially prompted me to remind myself and you of the importance of the quality of gentleness that should be found in all our affairs - in deeds, in speech, in communication with people.
                    People are eager for attention, nice words, understanding, gentle approach ...
                    Let us be of those who are kind to themselves, parents, brothers, sisters, relatives, neighbors and, in general, to all people.
                    And know:
                    "As much as there is gentleness among us, there is also Allah's love for us!"

                <p class="p1">
                    "And the believers are friends with one another: they seek to do good deeds, and they turn away from the wicked, and they perform the prayer and give zakat, and they obey Allah and His Messenger. These are they whom Allah will surely have mercy on. - Allah is indeed strong and wise. " (Et-Tevba, 71)
                    Another is a mirror to another - a saying we all hear about in the early years of our lives.
                    How many times in your life have you been convinced of the correctness of these words? I am sure that at least once in our lives, perhaps by our own example, we have witnessed a great change of insan for the better or for the worse after he changed his society.
                    Who is your mirror?
                    A good friend whom you love and who loves you in the name of Allah, azza wa jalla, will warn you of potential mistakes, give you honest advice, support you in good, give you a shoulder to cry on, and share with you moments of joy, so they will they multiply.
                    If you find yourself in this description, rejoice, because in the hadith for two people who fell in love in the name of Allah, azza wa jalla, they met and parted on that love, Allah's shade is promised on the Day of Judgment, when there will be no shade other than His . (part of hadith - transmitted by Bukhari)
                    A sincere friend means joy in terms of our existence and our faith. Thank the Supreme Lord for this grace for which you have joy in this world, and even greater joy for the world to come.
                    Tip: Grace is nurtured with gratitude, and friendship requires special attention and devotion, so dedicate yourself to your friend.
                    I ask the Supreme Creator to unite us in this world and the world to come with His sincere and good slaves, not to deny their closeness to our souls, even if we were once torn apart by physical distances.

                <p class="p1">
                    "The best of you are those who are best to your family, and I am the best of you to my family." (Tirmidhi)
                    The family is the basic building block of a healthy and successful social order.
                    What is the root of a tree is a family to a society. It all starts and continues to branch out.
                    We live in a time where everything is normal, except for the normal evaluation of things, and where they try in every way to deprive us of the possibility of knowing the value of the family, placing things like extramarital affairs, homosexuality, fornication, immorality, etc.
                    It is difficult for a person in such an environment to realize the true values ​​and to implement them as such in his life.
                    Here's a little help:
                    How do we see God's grace as a family?
                    The family provides us with:
                     - a sense of belonging, because belonging to a community is important to a person as a social being;
                    - sense of security;
                    - love, peace, prosperity;
                    - healthy relationships;
                    - support ...
                    You can continue this sequence on your own. Take a piece of paper and write down what the family means to you.
                    Do you want to be the best at something?
                    I'm already guessing the answer, and here's my suggestion that can help you:
                    BE THE BEST TOWARDS YOUR FAMILY.
                    By doing so, you protect yourself, you are grateful to Allah for the bounty He has given you, and you help the progress of the society in which you live.
                    Isn't that wonderful?

                "Life in this world is nothing but entertainment and play, and only That world is life, if only they knew!" (Al-Ankabut, 64)
                Verses that somehow always come to me as a medicine, as an ointment on a wound ... and to me, and to those with whom I remember them in conversation. We often hear from people regret, dissatisfaction, ignorance of why we are actually where we are. Let sorrow creep into the hearts of people who seek the purpose of life exclusively in the worldly dimension. Why didn't I succeed? Why don't I have this? How could he tell me that? Did I deserve it?
                There are endless questions, and the search for answers leads to various iman and psychic deviations, in the worst case to an unhappy life from which we all try so hard to escape.
                When you are overwhelmed by such thoughts, when you complain to people who cannot help you or avert trouble, remember that you are a traveler here, and remember the One Who gives life and death, Who governs every detail of your life; Remember these verses and countless others to which the Lord tells us why we are here! Remember the purpose of your existence, and the very purpose I am talking about is the one in which you will only find peace and happiness, and which will determine absolutely everything else. It makes worldly things take on a hereafter dimension, and that everything you do - you do with a higher goal! That is what brings true happiness.
                Finally, with thanks and prayers to Allah to make us of those who live happily and with purpose, I will quote the words of the Prophet, sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam, which guide us on where to direct our thoughts and worries, and what gives life meaning: " Whose concern is the hereafter, Allah will give him wealth in the heart, will make him calm and the world will come to him humbly, and whose concern is the world, Allah will give him poverty before his eyes, will make him distracted and from the world will not come to him except so much as prescribed. " (Tirmidhi, and Shaykh Albani judged it credible in the Sahih of Sunan Tirmidhi, 2465)

                "Lord, how can I thank You, when You give me blessings, and then through those blessings you reward me, shower me with blessings after grace. Graces are from You and gratitude is from You, so how can I thank You, Lord?" Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Zuhd, p. 132)
                He is a truly happy man whose heart is not blind to blessings. With the realization of grace, a person becomes satisfied with his life and possessions, which makes him happy, optimistic and motivated, and with all that, grateful to Allah who honored him with the same.
                When you enjoy the sound - stop, and imagine that you do not have the power to hear.
                When you are waiting to see something - close your eyes, and imagine that you do not have the power to see.
                When you go to comfort a crying friend - be silent, and imagine that you do not have the power to speak.
                When you rush to remove the boiling coffee - stop, and imagine that you do not have the power to walk.
                "That's how you'll know a piece of grace, and we don't know their number." So you will be grateful and satisfied.
                One of the benefits of knowing grace is the healing of the heart from a vicious disease: envy. Whom will a person aware of only the listed blessings, but truly aware, be able to envy ?! No, he cannot envy, because he is gifted with special abilities, because he is with his senses, his mind and his heart, much more than any hero from a fairy tale and a miraculous being from mythology - because Allah said in His noble book : "We create man in accordance with the most beautiful." (Qur'an, At-Tin, verse 4)
                Make us grateful and “those first, always first”, ya Rabb!
