"And if you should count the favor of Allah, you could not enumerate them."[14:34] Have you ever tried to make a list of Allah's bounties?
How often do you remember the blessings and thank Allah for them? Discover the Blessings is a group whose main purpose is to remind us daily of a particular grace, to reflect on its importance and to thank the One who gave them to us, and, indeed, their number is innumerable. They are so present in our lives, that sometimes we are not even aware that they are blessings, but we consider them as something that had to be, something that is our right.

Our Lord says in the Qur'an, "If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]; but if you deny, indeed, My punishment is severe." [14:7] Let us not forget that gratitude for bounty means to use it as Allah is pleased with!

So, the team of admins will share texts about blessings with you every day. Also, as we believe that each of us can notice something that the other has not yet, and we want to notice and remind ourselves as many blessings as possible, each member can write his text about a certain benefits and send to otkrjblagodati@gmail.com. All the texts that pass the sharia review of Hafiz Halida Dacic-Dazdarevic, will be timely distributed here in a group with all of us. The mentioned hafiz is both the admin of the group and its sharia reviewer. Do not forget: "And speak of the grace of your Lord!" [93:11]

               <p>When you enjoy the sound - stop, and imagine that you do not have the power to hear.
                When you are waiting to see something - close your eyes, and imagine that you do not have the power to see.
                When you go to comfort a crying friend - be silent, and imagine that you do not have the power to speak.
                When you rush to remove the boiling coffee - stop, and imagine that you do not have the power to walk.
                "That's how you'll know a piece of grace, and we don't know their number." Then you will be grateful and satisfied.</p>

                <p>The rain that falls cleans the surface of the earth, as well as the air from pollution. But it does not stop there, but goes to the deeper layers of the earth, where, flowing through the rocks, it purifies and dissolves minerals. As such, it feeds the plants with the help of roots, so we get a variety of fruits that we eat, use as medicines, as well as in many other applications, ranging from cosmetics to the production of gum.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-custom"> From the text "The blessing of the older people"</h3>
                <p>You don't always have to accept what an older person tells you, but you can, and you should think about it nicely, and not categorically reject it, without thinking.
                    It is necessary - because many people today are longing for scars on their souls, and they would not be there, if they had only thought a little better about the advice that was given to them.</p>

            <p>Arrange the field of your prayers - they, due to lack of conviction, have already withered, strengthen them with perseverance in the same, and support them by relying on Allah Almighty. Cast out the dark clouds of haram around the soul, to illuminate them. Protect them with alms and good deeds; free yourself from the persistent weeds of hopelessness, and shed tears of sincerity.
